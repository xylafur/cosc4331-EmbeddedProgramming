        In the video, that based on how it is wired, it should be the same for
        both motors - so forward is forward for the robot, irregardless of the
        motor

    I don't understand how this is going to work, from the DRV8837 datasheet it
    looks as though we need VM connected to our batteries - VM is the motor
    voltage.  WE have VCC connected, but all VCC is is the logic circuits.

    Found the answer here from the driver board site:
        By default, the drivers’ motor voltage (VM) is supplied by the board’s
        switched battery voltage, VSW, and their logic voltage (VCCMD) is
        supplied by the on-board regulator output, VREG (5 V by default). If
        you want to customize these voltages, you can cut the jumpers labeled
        VM = VSW and VCCMD = VREG and connect appropriate supplies to the VM
        and VCCMD pins.
