/*
 * The algorithm will return a LeftTooClose (4) error if the left sensor is
 * less than 212, and return a RightTooClose (2) error if the right sensor is
 * less than 212. The algorithm will return a CenterTooClose (1) error if the
 * front sensor is less than 150 mm. It will be possible for there to be
 * multiple simultaneou
 *
 * If the robot were within Â±50mm from the center of the road with the straight
 * or blocked scenarios, the side sensors could range from 212 to 354 mm. The
 * 354 threshold will be used to classify whether or not it is possible to turn
 * left or right at the next intersection. Less than 354 means turn path not
 * possible; 354 or above means turn path is possible
 *
 * As the robot approaches the intersection, the center sensor will be used to
 * classify the difference between {Blocked, Right Turn, Left Turn, and Tee
 * Joint} (center sensor less than 600 mm) and {Straight, Right Joint, Left
 * Joint, and Cross Road} (center sensor more than 600 mm).
