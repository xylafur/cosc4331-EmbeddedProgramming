To run this program, make sure you have all of the programs mentioned in the
install script from the root of this project!

Then run 'make qemu' in one terminal
    - this will build the ARM executable using the cross compiler

And run 'make gdb' in another terminal
    - this will start arm-gdb, link it up with the qemu session, then set a
      breakpoint at where errors are counted, then will print out the number of
      errors encountered


If you want to debug or check out a particular part of the program, you will
have to edit the file: 'gdb-file' or just envoke gdb yourself
