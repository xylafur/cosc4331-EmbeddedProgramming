To integrate the line sensor with the FSM, we would first add more states (we
have dont this) which corespond to different locations on the sensor (center,
left, far left, off on the left side, etc..) and then determine how we want to
write the motors for each of these situations.

For example if we are in the center we would just drive straight, both wheels
with the same speed.

If we were waaaay off to the left, we would turn right hard.

If we were rust a little off to the right, we would spin the left wheel a
little faster than the right wheel.

Basically all you have to do is instead of blinking leds based on your state,
drive the motors in a particular way based on your state
